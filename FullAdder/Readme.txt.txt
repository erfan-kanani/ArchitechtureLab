Implementing a 64-bit full-Adder using carry-look-ahead method 
	-first i made a 1-bit adder which add two single bit data and produces a sum and a carry
	-then i made 4-bit full-adder using the 1-bit adder i made before and for the carries that produces from each adder i define a wire
	-making 16-bit adder using 4 * 4-bit adder
	-making 64 bit full adder finally
